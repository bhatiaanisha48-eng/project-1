Machine Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance

Objective: The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classification model that can predict whether a machine is likely to fail or not.

Description: In industrial environments, unexpected machine failures can lead to production downtime, increased operational costs, and safety risks.Traditional maintenance strategies such as reactive maintenance (repair after failure) or scheduled maintenance (fixed time intervals) are inefficient and costl
